- Her (2013)
Her involves a man named Theodore who gets an operating system upgrade that includes an AI virtual assistant.  He gives the AI a female voice and names it Samantha, and has frequent discussions about life.  They eventually start talking about relationships, and start a relationship of their own, which helps out in his writing career.  She later informs him that she and the other AIs are leaving for a space outside of the physical world, and Theodore moves on with a real-world relationship.  This movie is an interesting perspective on a home assistant actually evolving and becoming more like a real person.  This could be a possible avenue of advancement of smart home and AI technology in the future.
