- Smart House
1999 Disney's Smart House features a family winning a fully computerized house.  The house begins by making the lives of the family easier doing things for them.  The house eventually turns against the family and traps them inside.  The movie presents smart home technology as something to be feared.  

# Iron Man (2008)

![J.A.R.V.I.S. overlay in Iron Man](/_assets/jarvis.png) In Iron Man Tony Stark has a smart assistant system named J.A.R.V.I.S. (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) J.A.R.V.I.S. is initially just a very advanced voice assistant that allows Stark to speak to interact with the computer systems controlling his house. While J.A.R.V.I.S. is very integrated into every part of the house and at one point Stark is even woken after a one night stand by J.A.R.V.I.S. talking to him, the movie never presents the technology in a way that would raise privacy concerns or make people mistrust their smart home assistants.
