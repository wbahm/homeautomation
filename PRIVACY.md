# Privacy
There are several applications to home technology that can help with music, temperature settings, internet access, etc. However, with these many applications, there is a strong concern regarding privacy for how much control is given to the home technology.

For example, the Amazon Echo product is designed to record audio from various types of triggers that do not involve saying "Alexa" [11]. Amazon justifies doing this as a way to improve the Artificial Intelligence behind the Echo so that it may do a better job of serving their customers [11]. At the same time, these audio recordings are not deleted unless specifically requested or unless the customer searches through the audio recording history of the Echo [11]. This opens up an area where data is potentially every word spoken in a household which would most definitely be interpreted as a violation of privacy. So now an issue arises that asks where is the line between the acquisition of data and violations of privacy. This question does not have an official answer from government legislature, so an abundance of data is now in the hands of Amazon where they can use it any way they want [11].
