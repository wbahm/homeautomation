Given their central location in the home and their mostly silent operation smart speakers create new possibilities for serious errors.  Failures can result in serious privacy issues.  For example a woman in Portland, Oregon discovered that her Alexa was sending recordings to the phone of one of her husband's employees[1].  According to Amazon this issue was caused by Alexa hearing key phrases in the conversation and interpreting them as commands[2].
